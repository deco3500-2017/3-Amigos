## 1.0 Introduction
Effective communication between teachers and parents is a necessity to ensure the success of a school. Communication in schools can be classified as either one-way or two-way. One-way communication occurs when teachers aim to inform the parents about learning activities and resources, school events and the progress of a child. Whereas, two-way communication between both parents and teachers endorses positive relations, is the key to effective and efficient engagement in schools and ensures the best outcome for a child.  Nevertheless, a recent survey performed by research institution, Gallup found that only 20% of parents feel “fully engaged and involved” in their child’s learning signalling a lack in both one-way and two-way communication. In changing times, teachers must continue to develop and expand their skills in order to maximise effective communication with parents. Utilising modern technology, this proposal presents a communication opportunity available to schools and teachers to reduce the barriers to effective communication. The proposal also describes the team who created the concept, their communication methods throughout the duration of the project and the project plan.  

## 2.0 Concept
EduBoard addresses the community problem domain with an education focus. The concept effectively combines multiple communication and sharing platforms like Trello, Google Drive, Slack and Padlet to create a real-time and virtual collaboration tool to enhance children’s learning. Specifically, Eduboard is a web-based application utilising a modern and collaborative interface, which aims to enhance the communication between teachers and parents within schools. Its application nature also allows for users to easily view and upload content from their mobile phone. Moreover, using modern technology, EduBoard has the intent to foster an environment whereby parents feel more engaged and involved in their child’s learning, which will ultimately encourage parents to further assist their children. The primary target audience is parents of primary school aged children where fundamental learning activities are present. Hence, Eduboard is a platform for sharing this educational content. 

EduBoard is a dashboard and padlet like system, whereby teachers can share learning and school resources with parents via a simple post. Learning resources encompass classroom goals, lesson plans, reading material that informs lesson plans, tutorial videos, homework materials and homework assistance resources. Moreover, school resources includes attendance and behavioural records, regular event updates, school newsletters and academic calendars.   Ultimately what the teacher shares depends on what they deem to be most useful to the parents, the purpose of Eduboard is to be a sharing format that is flexible to the needs of the teacher. 

In terms of usability, each teacher and or class possesses a dashboard and each parent is encouraged to create an account. The teacher invites a particular parent to join the dashboard with the classroom password. Utilising their account and classroom password, a parent has access to the teacher’s dashboard. When a teacher uploads content, each resource is tagged and filtered into a category. Tagged items can be viewed in each category on the left hand side of the dashboard. This effectively allows for ease of filtering results and locating content. Online messaging is also available in Eduboard whereby there is a general chat channel between all users of that particular dashboard. Further, there is the option to privately message the teacher. However, to avoid constant messaging, the left hand side of the dashboard also showcases a frequently asked questions section with appropriate answers. 

The concept of Eduboard specifically applies to the social and mobile theory of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) as coined by Irene Greif and Paul Cashman in 1984. Eduboard also applies to the concept of Collaborative Learning Work and Collaboration Awareness as presented by Dr. Charles Findley in 1987. Both these theories address how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems. Eduboard adheres to these theories as the concept is a centralised and shared information space where all activity is represented. Moreover, Eduboard is designed for multi-user collaboration, synchronous communication and concurrent work is possible as it is a different time and different place matrix. Finally, Eduboard also fosters an explicit and direct social environment whereby users are represented in the system and there is minimal anonymity. This effectively reduces acts of aggression, bullying and harassment. As the presence of social and mobile technology is increasing in the 21st century, adopting these theories in the design and development of Eduboard will enhance the usability and functionality of the concept.

## 3.0 Team
The team encompasses three members, who are:

Name | Student Number | Slack | GitHub
-----|------ | -------|-------|
Abigail Hume | 43931884 | abhume97 | abhume
Alison Collins | 4359224 | s4359224 | alsatiax
Gabby Mendoza | 43952898 | gooby | Hachiko97

### 3.1 Team Leader
Abigail is the designated leader. However, so far we have found that all group members take initiative, are invested in the project and work well collaboratively. This allows for all group members to lead conversation where necessary, which we feel will allow for us to work more productively and cooperatively. 
### 3.2 Team Roles
Gabby is our designated logistics manager, he will be responsible for organising meetings and collating minute meetings and documents. 
Alison is our GitHub and task flow manager, she will be responsible for updating and checking GitHub issues and ZenHub task lists and ensuring that all tasks to be completed are explained and assigned to team members.
All group members are competent graphic designers, researchers, UX designers and prototyping developers. Hence, we will have no key roles which will determine the designation of work, allowing for all group members to complete any tasks as necessary. Task allocation will be done to ensure that all group members receive an even workload, taking into account other commitments that may prevent work being complete rather than based solely on skillsets. That said, Gabby’s specialty is graphic design and back end, Abigail’s specialty is marketing and UI and Alison’s specialty is research and UX, so task allocation will be based around these areas where possible. By having all team members that are competent in numerous task areas allows us to more easily work collaboratively together throughout the entire design process and we will prioritise working together for all components of the project. We hope that this plan for work distribution will not only result in each team member being able to competently and capably complete their assigned work before the due date but also allow for team members to try their hand at new skills to enhance their knowledge base and confidence in a team environment.
### 3.3 Decision Making
Decisions will be made in consultation with all group members. Discussion will occur on the Facebook Messenger chat so all team members have access to discussions. Major decisions will require the unanimous agreement of the team as this will ensure that all team members are on the same page about the progress progression. As we only have three team members, reaching an unanimous agreement should be easily possible. 
### 3.4 Conflict Resolution
Poor performance within the team will be resolved in a mature manner. If any team member feels another team member is not performing to a satisfactory standard or is not pulling their weight within the team, the first resolution step is to mention their concerns to the team member. Once the issue is discussed honestly and openly, both parties will be allowed to voice their opinions and excuses for greater clarity regarding the situation. If after the discussion the team member is still considered not to be performing to a satisfactory level, a group meeting will be held to discuss strategies and consequences. These consequences may concern a decrease in PAF score at the end of the course by all other team members and/or informing workshop tutors to discuss with the underperforming team member. 
Team conflict will be resolved through open, mature and honest team discussion. All team members will attend a team meeting which will air any issues or conflict. If after this discussion resolution cannot be reached, a tutor will be consulted and their opinion on the situation sought. 

## 4.0 Communications
### 4.1 Communication Platforms
Our team will be primarily using Facebook Messenger to communicate. We have chosen this social platform, as we are familiar with how to use it, and already have access to the service.
We will also be utilising ZenHub to outline tasks and visualise our project progress. We have chosen to adopt this to help us be organised, to ensure we meet all deadlines on time. GitHub issues will also be used to assign group tasks, specifically those directly related to assessment requirements. 
Slack will be used to contact the course teaching staff privately, regarding any queries or concerns, through the Social and Mobile Computing group.
### 4.2 Meetings
#### 4.1.1 Meeting Venue
Our team will  conduct meetings every Tuesday (Building 49-316, 12:00 P.M. - 2:00 P.M.)  and Friday (Building 78-109, 10:00 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.) during the allocated workshop and practical sessions.  
#### 4.1.2 Supplementary Meetings
Supplementary meetings can be organised, however, the team must be informed of the proposed date and location, 48 hours in advance. All members are expected to attend all meetings, unless agreed upon otherwise.
#### 4.1.3 Attendance
If a team member is unable to attend a meeting, the team must be informed 24 hours in advance, prior the specified meeting date. If an unexpected event prohibits the team member from attending the meeting, they will be excused if a reasonable excuse is provided. He/she will also be responsible to catch up by reading the meeting minutes.
A scribe will also be designated to record meeting minutes and key outcomes. This document will be made available immediately after the meeting has commenced, on the team’s  Google Drive.
### 4.3 Files
#### 4.3.1 File Storage and Sharing
Files will be stored and shared on Google Drive and GitHub. This platform has been all group members can access it easily.
#### 4.3.2 Naming Conventions
The name of the file must encompass the document’s title and purpose. It must use sentence case, and must be separated using white spaces. 
#### 4.3.3 Drafts and Final Copies
Drafts should be uploaded in an editable format, modifiable using Google’s web-based software. Final copies of a document should be saved as a PDF, so it can be uploaded easily.
